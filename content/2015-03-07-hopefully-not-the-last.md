People don’t usually complain about being “busy” when their time is filled with things that they enjoy doing. My guess is that there is an imbalance between what they *want* to do, and what they *have* to do.

This is the inaugural post for my new blog. It’s a product of me being “busy” lately, and trying to find some sanity and balance in a project that I want to do. When I look at it in this way, I’m thankful that I regularly find myself feeling busy. These time constraints push me to focus more on what I want to do and better use the free moments of the day. So there you have it, my first meaningful post.
