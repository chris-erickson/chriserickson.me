I have seen suggestions that the rationale for the new trackpad is because Apple [needed or wanted ](http://www.macworld.com/article/2895758/the-macbooks-new-trackpad-will-change-the-way-you-click.html) it to be thinner for the new [MacBook](http://www.apple.com/macbook/):

> This is all presumably to drive a little more thickness of out of the MacBook

or [this](http://www.macstories.net/news/apples-all-new-macbook-our-complete-overview/):

> Another casualty in Apple’s ruthless quest for thinness is the trackpad’s clicking mechanism.

Looking at teardown comparisons between the [old](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2013+Teardown/18695#s53258) and [new](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Retina+Display+Early+2015+Teardown/38300#s86966) MacBook, it seems that the thicknesses of the two trackpad units are hardly different - the new one may even be thicker!  Additionally, the old trackpad looks mechanically simpler - space savings don't usually ride in on the backs of more large components.  I think this is a testbed for a technology that Apple wants to make much more use of in the future — it's not a space saving objective.
