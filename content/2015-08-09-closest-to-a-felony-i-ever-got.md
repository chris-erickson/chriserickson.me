> A 14-year-old eighth grader in Florida, Domanik Green, has been charged with a felony for “hacking” his teacher’s computer. The “hacking” in this instance was using a widely known password to change the desktop background of his teacher’s computer with an image of two men kissing.

I count my lucky stars that my treatment in elementary school for changing folder icon colors and logically arranging aliases into them on the classroom computers was more forgiving.  I was banned from computer class and put in detention where I had to put batteries in remotes for all the new TV's the district had just purchased.

Now that my probation has been served, I can change icons and sort things with reckless abandon.  Excuse me while I do some hacking.
