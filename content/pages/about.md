title: About

Just an assortment of things about me, since Facebook isn't going to provide you many clues.

## How I Keep the Lights On

I'm currently a Front End Engineer at [Northwestern Mutual](https://www.northwesternmutual.com), where I build React apps. I was last a Web Application Developer at [GS](https://www.gsdesign.com) in Glendale, WI.  Prior to this, I went to [Milwaukee School of Engineering](http://www.msoe.edu) two times; first for Mechanical Engineering, then a handful of years later for Computer Engineering.  As a Mechanical Engineer I [led a team](http://www.emteq.com) to design most of the lighting you might find if you are ever so lucky to get a ride on a [Gulfstream G650](http://www.gulfstream.com/aircraft/gulfstream-g650), in addition to a wide variety of other LED aircraft lighting.  I like to build web sites for companies that want modern, engaging customer experiences.

## When There is Time

I dabble with HAM radio, love to cook, make pretentious drinks, and attempt photography.
